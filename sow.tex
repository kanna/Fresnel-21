\subsection{Statement of Work}

\paragraph{Roles and responsibilities} \univ will be the lead
organization, provide aerial, surface and underwater vehicles,
communication equipment and command/control software while
coordinating all activities. Funding requested will primarily support
students and staff in Porto for software development and operations.
\inst will provide the assimilation, modeling and prediction with
shore-side models. In addition \inst will conduct CTD and vessel
mounted observations onboard the research vessel and also provide
access to their research vessel as well as a RHIB or rigid boat. \mit
will support \inst for \texttt{HOPS} modeling and augmentation for ML
capabilities. \colo and \ave will work on making bio-optical and
biological measurements and providing analysis and data to augment
\inst modeling. Table \ref{tab:roles} summarizes the roles and
contributions of all partners.
