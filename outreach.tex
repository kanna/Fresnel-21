\section{Outreach}

\univ has had continued and extensive engagement over the years with the
local authorities including the \naz city officials and local fishermen.
As a result we will engage the fishing community to carry our low cost
temperature/density sensors and also help provide access to the team to
be able to commute to the islands when necessary, subject to health
protocols. In addition, we expect to engage local high school students
prior and after the experiment, to entice them into thinking about
careers in science and technology, much as we have done in the past with
success in another ONR funded
program~\footnote{\url{https://sunfish.lsts.pt/en/outreach/education}}.

With the world-wide interest in the area \proj will also work with the
local authorities and \univ to showcase our work in Portuguese and
English language media outlets.

Finally, publications resulting from the project will be targeted
towards peer-reviewed journals including \emph{Science Robotics,
  J. Field Robotics, Int. J. of Robotics Research, AI Journal,
  Autonomous Robots, Oceanography, PLOSone, Frontiers} and high-impact
conferences such as \emph{AAAI, IJCAI, ISER, ICAPS, RSS, IROS, ICRA
  and IEEE AUV} where we have frequently published.
