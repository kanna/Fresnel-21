\section{Outreach}

\inst has had continued and extensive engagement over the years with the
local authorities including the \naz city officials and local fishermen.
As a result we will engage the fishing community to carry our low cost
temperature/density sensors and also help provide access to the team to
be able to commute to the islands when necessary, subject to health
protocols. In addition, we expect to engage local high school students
prior and after the experiment, to entice them into thinking about
careers in science and technology, much as we have done in the past with
success in another ONR funded
program~\footnote{\url{https://sunfish.lsts.pt/en/outreach/education}}.

With the world-wide interest in the \naz area, \proj will also work
with the local authorities and \univ outreach department to showcase
our work in Portuguese and English language media outlets. We will
invite ONR and other ocean science sponsors from the US and government
and private philanthropies to observe the field experiment, in-person
if possible. We are also investigating ways in which portions of the
experiment can be livestreamed and made available via Youtube. Imagery
will be uploaded to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as is routine at
the \ls lab~\footnote{See \url{https://lsts.pt}} with appropriate
context in both the Portuguese and English.

Finally, publications resulting from the project will be targeted
towards peer-reviewed journals including \emph{Science Robotics,
  J. Field Robotics, Int. J. of Robotics Research, AI Journal,
  Autonomous Robots, Oceanography, PLOSone, Frontiers} and high-impact
conferences such as \emph{AAAI, IJCAI, ISER, ICAPS, RSS, IROS, ICRA
  and IEEE AUV} where we have published frequently.
