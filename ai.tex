What kinds of robotic and AI methods we want to bring to make the observation and what kinds of novelty will we demonstrate?

\proj will leverage the considerable efforts in decision-making using
Artificial Intelligence methods targeting marine robotics. Our own
efforts revolve around operationalizing autonomous aerial, surface and
underwater platforms with embedded or off-shore decision-making capacity
which focus on the sense-plan-act control loop embedded on autonomous
vehicles.
