\section{Project Management}

This collaborative effort is in part to advance our understanding of
the bio-geophysical processes in the \naz area, while advancing the
observational technology and capacity in the context of a much larger
concept in the form of the \met project\footnote{See US National
  Academies 'Ocean Shot' presentation at
  \url{https://vimeo.com/510346249}}. This effort aims to provide a
new paradigm of portable coastal ocean observation using space,
aerial, surface and underwater vehicles, coupled to assimilative
models.

\proj will be managed by the PI (Rajan) working closely with the
collaborators from \unive, \coloe, \mite, \soce,\avee and \inste. All
the key personnel have known and worked with one another over a
decade, some at sea. \univ will be the prime, where the PI has a
Visiting Professor position.
