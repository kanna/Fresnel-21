\section{Management Approach}

This collaborative effort is in part to advance our understanding of
the bio-geophysical processes in the \naz area, while advancing the
observational technology and capacity in the coastal ocean.  \proj
will be managed by the PI (Rajan, a US national) working closely with
the collaborators from the \texttt{Univ.~of Porto}, \texttt{Instituto
  Hidrogr\'{a}fico}, \texttt{Univ.~of Aveiro}, \texttt{Columbia
  Univ.}, \texttt{MIT} and \texttt{SOCIB}.  All key personnel have
known and worked with one another, most over a decade, some at
sea. \univ will be the prime, where the PI has a Visiting Professor
position.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Roles and responsibilities} \univ will be the lead
organization, provide aerial, surface and underwater vehicles,
communication equipment and command/control software while
coordinating all activities. Funding requested will primarily support
students and staff in Porto for the period of the experiment for
$\sim 20$ days. \inst will provide the assimilation, modeling and
prediction with shore-side models. In addition \inst will conduct CTD
and vessel mounted observations onboard the research vessel and also
provide access to their research vessel as well as a RHIB or rigid
boat. \mit will support \inst for \texttt{HOPS} modeling and
augmentation for ML capabilities. \colo and \ave will work on making
bio-optical and biological measurements and providing analysis and
data to augment \inst modeling. Table \ref{tab:roles} summarizes the
roles and contributions of all partners. \soc will provide a glider
and personnel for preparation, deployment, operations and support of
the vehicle as well as helping with the analysis of glider data during
and after the experiment. The roles and responsibilities of the key
personnel are summarized in Table \ref{tab:roles}.


\paragraph{Budget Request} Our funding request is highly leveraged
with equipment and people who are keen on participating in this
experiment. No salaries, or expensive ship-times are being requested,
instead we will be using existing assets which will be in the \naz
area for fixed periods of time and use robotic hardware and software
from \univ and \soce. Consequently, our budget reflects costs for
consumables, insurance, SatComs, and travel only. \univ is the primary
beneficiary of this request with minor requests for \inste, \avee,
\colo and \soc (Table \ref{tab:budget}). No funding is being
requested for \mite.
