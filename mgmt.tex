\section{Project Management}

This collaborative effort is in part to advance our understanding of
the bio-geophysical processes in the \naz area, while advancing the
observational technology and capacity in the context of a much larger
concept in the form of the \met project\footnote{See US National
  Academies 'Ocean Shot' presentation at
  \url{https://vimeo.com/510346249}}. This effort aims to provide a
new paradigm of portable coastal ocean observation using space,
aerial, surface and underwater vehicles, coupled to assimilative
models.

\proj will be managed by the PI (Rajan, a US national) working closely
with the collaborators from the \texttt{Univ. of Porto},
\texttt{Instituto Hidrogr\'{a}fico}, \texttt{Univ. of Aveiro},
\texttt{Columbia Univ.}, \texttt{MIT} and \texttt{SOCIB}.  All key
personnel have known and worked with one another, most over a decade,
some at sea. \univ will be the prime, where the PI has a Visiting
Professor position. The roles and responsibilities of the key
personnel are shown in Table \ref{tab:roles}.
